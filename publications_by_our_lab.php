Antibody genes can further diversify through somatic hypermutation (SHM) in germinal centers (GCs), leading to improved affinities toward antigens. Several mechanisms are in place to handle specificities that recognize self at several stages of development, including the early developmental phases and the GC diversification stage. The presence of secreted autoantibodies that react to self are generally thought of as breakdowns of tolerance mechanisms.

Despite differences of allergen administration, there are some similarities of immunologic responses across platforms, with a general theme involving the restructuring and polarization of adaptive and innate immune effector cells. Here we review the immunology of AIT across various delivery platforms, including subcutaneous, sublingual, epicutaneous, intradermal, and intralymphatic approaches, emphasizing shared mechanisms associated with achieving immunologic non-responsiveness to allergen.

            In this issue of Cell, three studies confirm that SARS-CoV-2 Omicron strongly evades a key immune defense-neutralizing antibodies. However, while one- or two-dose vaccine regimens fail to induce anti-Omicron neutralizing antibodies, a homologous third-dose booster rescues neutralization function in a way that highlights the adaptability of immune memory, where recalled immunity extends antibody reach across SARS-CoV-2 variants.

            Key features of immune memory are greater and faster antigen-specific antibody responses to repeat infection.

We find that a two-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination regimen given after natural infection generated greater longitudinal antibody stability and induced maximal antibody magnitudes with enhanced breadth across Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants. A homologous third messenger RNA vaccine dose in COVID-naïve individuals conferred greater cross-variant evenness of neutralization potency with stability that was equal to the hybrid immunity conferred by infection plus vaccination. Within unvaccinated individuals who recovered from COVID, enhanced antibody stability over time was observed within a subgroup of individuals who recovered more quickly from COVID and harbored significantly more memory B cells cross-reactive to endemic coronaviruses early after infection. These cross-reactive clones map to the conserved S2 region of SARS-CoV-2 spike with higher somatic hypermutation levels and greater target affinity. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 antigen challenge histories in humans influence not only the speed and magnitude of antibody responses but also functional cross-variant antibody repertoire composition and longevity.

To determine the Delta and Omicron BA.1 variant specificity of B cell repertoires established by an initial Wuhan strain infection, we measured neutralization potencies of 73 antibodies from an unbiased survey of the early memory B cell response. Antibodies recognizing each of three previously defined epitopic regions on the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) varied in neutralization potency and variant-escape resistance. The ACE2 binding surface ("RBD-2") harbored the binding sites of neutralizing antibodies with the highest potency but with the greatest sensitivity to viral escape; two other epitopic regions on the RBD ("RBD-1" and "RBD-3") bound antibodies of more modest potency but greater breadth. The structures of several Fab:spike complexes that neutralized all five variants of concern tested, including one Fab each from the RBD-1, -2, and -3 clusters, illustrated the determinants of broad neutralization and showed that B cell repertoires can have specificities that avoid immune escape driven by public antibodies. The structure of the RBD-2 binding, broad neutralizer shows why it retains neutralizing activity for Omicron BA.1, unlike most others in the same public class. Our results correlate with real-world data on vaccine efficacy, which indicate mitigation of disease caused by Omicron BA.1.

(1) found that gut tissue is a likely place for IgE development in peanut-allergic individuals. In addition, despite vast sequence possibilities, they found that many individuals share similar peanut-reactive IgE DNA sequences. This suggests that IgE antibodies in different individuals recognize peanut proteins in a similar manner, which could inform strategies for pharmacological interventions.

            Antibodies are key immune effectors that confer protection against pathogenic threats. The nature and longevity of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not well defined. We charted longitudinal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 92 subjects after symptomatic COVID-19. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are unimodally distributed over a broad range, with symptom severity correlating directly with virus-specific antibody

Virus-specific IgG decayed substantially in most individuals, whereas a distinct subset had stable or increasing antibody levels in the same time frame despite similar initial antibody magnitudes. These individuals with increasing responses recovered rapidly from symptomatic COVID-19 disease, harbored increased somatic mutations in virus-specific memory B cell antibody genes, and had persistent higher frequencies of previously activated CD4+ T cells. These findings illuminate an efficient immune phenotype that connects symptom clearance speed to differential antibody durability dynamics.

            Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) can develop granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD), which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Treating GLILD is a significant challenge because it is rare and can be pathologically heterogeneous. Here we describe two cases of patients with CVID-associated GLILD with biopsies demonstrating loosely organized tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs

Based on the pivotal role that B cells play in TLS initiation and maintenance, we hypothesized that using rituximab monotherapy for B-cell depletion alone would be sufficient for the disruption of the pathologic process underlying GLILD. These two cases demonstrate that adapting a strategy of B cell depletion monotherapy may be effective in TLS-associated conditions such as GLILD.

Activation-induced somatic hypermutation (SHM), which further diversifies Ig V regions, is also met with strong selection that shapes Ig affinity maturation. While individual repertoire features, such as affinity for self and competition for foreign antigen, are known to drive selection, the selection filters themselves may be subject to regulation. Large sequence freedom coupled with strong selection for each diversification process provides flexibility for demand-driven regulation to dynamically balance antigen recognition capacities and associated autoimmune risks according to host needs.

This enrichment affected follicular B cells, involving a diverse set of Ig-variable region gene segments, and was T cell-independent. Functionally, enrichment of microbe reactivity primed basal levels of small intestinal T cell-independent, symbiont-reactive IgA and enhanced systemic IgG responses to bacterial immunization. These results demonstrate that microbial symbionts influence host immunity by enriching frequencies of antibacterial specificities within preimmune B cell repertoires and that this may have consequences for mucosal and systemic immunity.

In this regard, sample preparation and sequence analysis techniques, which have largely been borrowed and adapted from other fields, continue to evolve. Here, we review current methods and challenges of library preparation, sequencing and statistical analysis of lymphocyte receptor repertoire studies. We discuss the general steps in the process of immune repertoire generation including sample preparation, platforms available for sequencing, processing of sequencing data, measurable features of the immune repertoire, and the statistical tools that can be used for analysis and interpretation of the data. Because BCR analysis harbors additional complexities, such as immunoglobulin (Ig) (i.e., antibody) gene somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, the emphasis of this review is on Ig/BCR sequence analysis.

            Two immunoglobulin (Ig) diversification mechanisms collaborate to provide protective humoral immunity. Combinatorial assembly of IgH and IgL V region exons from gene segments generates preimmune Ig repertoires, expressed as B cell receptors (BCRs). Secondary diversification occurs when Ig V regions undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity-based selection toward antigen in activated germinal center (GC) B cells. Secondary di

            versification is thought to only ripen the antigen-binding affinity of Igs that already exist (i.e., cognate Igs) because of chance generation during preimmune Ig diversification. However, whether stochastic activation of noncognate B cells can generate new affinity to antigen in GCs is unclear. Using a mouse model whose knock-in BCR does not functionally engage with immunizing antigen, we found that chronic immunization induced antigen-specific serological responses with diverse SHM-mediated antibody affinity maturation pathways and divergent epitope targeting. Thus, intrinsic GC B cell flexibility allows for somatic, noncognate B cell evolution, permitting de novo antigen recognition and subsequent antibody affinity maturation without initial preimmune BCR engagement.

            ering polyclonal Ighγ1/γ1 and Ighε/ε mice, which initially produce IgG1 or IgE from their respective native genomic configurations. We found that B cells from wild-type mice, as well as Ighγ1/γ1 and Ighε/ε mice, produce transcripts that generate IgM, IgG1, and IgE in an alternative splice form bias hierarchy, regardless of cell stage. In this regard, we found that mIgμ > mIgγ1 > mIgε, and that these BCR expression differences influence respective developmental fitness. Restrained B cell development from Ighγ1/γ1 and Ighε/ε mice was proportional to sIg/mIg ratios and was rescued by enforced expression of the respective mIgs. In addition, artificially enhancing BCR signal strength permitted IgE+ memory B cells-which essentially do not exist under normal conditions-to provide long-lived memory function, suggesting that quantitative BCR signal weakness contributes to restraint of IgE B cell responses. Our results indicate that IgH isotype-specific mIg/BCR dosage may play a larger role in B cell fate than previously anticipated.

            The primary immunoglobulin repertoire develops via opposing forces of expanding diversification balanced by contracting selection mechanisms. The resulting shape is essential for host health and immune fitness. While the molecular mechanisms of Ig diversification have largely been defined, selection forces shaping emerging Ig repertoires are poorly understood.

During an early life window of time, the murine gut lamina propria harbors developing immature B cells in proximity to intestinal contents such as commensal microbes and dietary antigens. Location and timing of early B cell development may thus endow neighboring antigens with primary repertoire-shaping capabilities.

            Immunoglobulin (Ig) E is the most tightly regulated of all Ig heavy chain (IgH) isotypes and plays a key role in atopic disease. The gene encoding for IgH in mature B cells consists of a variable region exon-assembled from component gene segments via V(D)J recombination during early B cell development-upstream of a set of IgH constant region CH exons. Upon activation by antigen in peripheral lymphoid organs, B cells can undergo IgH

Activation of the IL-4 receptor on B cells, together with other signals, can lead to the replacement of Cμ with Cε resulting in CSR to IgE through a series of molecular events involving irreversible remodeling of the IgH locus. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanisms of CSR and the unique features surrounding the generation of IgE-producing B cells.

Here, I reviewed the structure and function of the microbiota and the known mechanisms of how nonpathogenic microbes influence B cell biology and immunoglobulin repertoire development early in life. I also discuss what is known about how B lineage cells contribute to the process of shaping the composition of commensal/mutualistic microbe membership.

While measurement of IgA and IgG subclasses is straightforward, measurement of IgE by this method is problematic due to soluble IgE binding to FcεRII/CD23 expressed on the surface of activated B cells. Here we describe a unique procedure for accurate measurement of IgE-producing mouse B cells that have undergone CSR in culture. The method is based on trypsin-mediated cleavage of IgE-CD23 complexes on cell surfaces, allowing for detection of IgE-producing B lineage cells by cytoplasmic staining. This procedure offers a convenient solution for flow cytometric analysis of CSR to IgE.

            The RAG1/RAG2 endonuclease (RAG) initiates the V(D)J recombination reaction that assembles immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light (IgL) chain variable region exons from germline gene segments to generate primary antibody repertoires. IgH V(D)J assembly occurs in progenitor (pro-) B cells followed by that of IgL in precursor (pre-) B cells. Expression of IgH μ and IgL (Igκ or Igλ) chains generates IgM, which is expressed on immature B

             cells as the B-cell antigen-binding receptor (BCR). Rag expression can continue in immature B cells, allowing continued Igκ V(D)J recombination that replaces the initial VκJκ exon with one that generates a new specificity. This 'receptor editing' process, which can also lead to Igλ V(D)J recombination and expression, provides a mechanism whereby antigen encounter at the Rag-expressing immature B-cell stage helps shape pre-immune BCR repertoires. As the major site of postnatal B-cell development, the bone marrow is the principal location of primary immunoglobulin repertoire diversification in mice. Here we report that early B-cell development also occurs within the mouse intestinal lamina propria (LP), where the associated V(D)J recombination/receptor editing processes modulate primary LP immunoglobulin repertoires. At weanling age in normally housed mice, the LP contains a population of Rag-expressing B-lineage cells that harbour intermediates indicative of ongoing V(D)J recombination and which contain cells with pro-B, pre-B and editing phenotypes. Consistent with LP-specific receptor editing, Rag-expressing LP B-lineage cells have similar VH repertoires, but significantly different Vκ repertoires, compared to those of Rag2-expressing bone marrow counterparts. Moreover, colonization of germ-free mice leads to an increased ratio of Igλ-expressing versus Igκ-expressing B cells specifically in the LP. We conclude that B-cell development occurs in the intestinal mucosa, where it is regulated by extracellular signals from commensal microbes that influence gut immunoglobulin repertoires.

            ammed into iPSCs that contribute to high-grade chimerism in mice. Treatment of naïve splenic B cells in culture with anti-CD40 plus IL-4 induces IgH CSR from IgM to IgG1 and IgE. CSR leads to irreversible IgH locus deletions wherein the IgM-producing Cμ exons are permanently excised from the B-cell genome. We find that anti-CD40 plus IL-4-activated B cells produce iPSCs that are uniformly hypermethylated in the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster and fail to produce chimerism in mice. However, treatment of activated B cells with the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine before and at early stages of reprogramming attenuates hypermethylation of the Dlk1-Dio3 locus in resultant iPSCs and enables them to form high-grade chimerism in mice. These conditions allowed us to produce chimeric mice in which all mature B cells were derived entirely from IgG1-expressing B-cell-derived iPSCs. We conclude that culture conditions of activated B cells before and at early stages of reprogramming influence the developmental potency of resultant iPSCs.

In this study, we report a role for B cell developmental maturity in IgE CSR. Based in part on a novel flow cytometric IgE CSR assay, we show that immature B cells preferentially switch to IgE versus IgG1 through a mechanism involving increased direct CSR from Cμ to Cε. Our findings suggest that IgE dysregulation in certain immunodeficiencies may be related to impaired B cell maturation.

The CD40 molecule has an important role in promoting inflammatory responses by macrophages/microglia, since interaction with its cognate ligand, CD154, leads to secretion of cytokines and neurotoxins. Aberrant CD40 expression by macrophages/microglia, induced by cytokines such as IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, contributes to neuroimmunologic cascades in the CNS. Strategies to suppress CD40 expression may attenuate inflammation and neuronal damage within the CNS, which will ultimately be of benefit in neuroinflammatory diseases. The mediators that regulate expression of CD40 in macrophages/microglia (both induction and inhibition) function at the level of gene transcription. In this review, we present an overview of the molecular basis of CD40 expression in macrophages/microglia. The signal transduction pathways and transcription factors employed by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha to induce CD40 expression are described, as are the cis-elements in the CD40 promoter that are critical for CD40 transcription. Information is provided on the mechanism(s) underlying suppression of CD40 in macrophages/microglia by immunomodulatory agents such as IL-4, TGF-beta, neuropeptides, neurotrophins, and statins. A comprehensive assessment of CD40 production and function in macrophages/microglia will establish the foundation for future therapeutic manipulation of this critical immunoregulatory protein.

            TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma cooperate in the activation of macrophages. TNF-alpha-dependent activation of NF-kappaB is stronger in the presence of IFN-gamma. STAT-1alpha associates with TNFR1 in TNF-alpha-treated cells, and this association attenuates TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation. We hypothesized that nuclear localization of STAT-1alpha due to IFN-gamma signaling would preclude it from being recruited to the TNFR1 and theref

In the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line, TNF-alpha treatment indeed recruits STAT-1alpha to the TNFR1, and this association is abrogated when cells are exposed to IFN-gamma. TNF-alpha treatment induces a more robust activation of NF-kappaB in STAT-1alpha-deficient cells, and restoration of STAT-1alpha inhibits TNF-alpha-dependent NF-kappaB activation. Our results suggest that a receptor-proximal level of cross-talk exists between these two cytokine pathways: IFN-gamma limits STAT-1alpha availability to the TNFR1 by depleting STAT-1alpha from the cytoplasm, thus allowing for optimal NF-kappaB activation upon TNF-alpha ligation.

            CD40 is a type I membrane-bound molecule belonging to the TNFR superfamily that is expressed on various immune cells including macrophages and microglia. The aberrant expression of CD40 is involved in the initiation and maintenance of various human diseases including multiple sclerosis, arthritis, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition of CD40 signaling has been shown to provide a significant beneficial effect in a nu

            mber of animal models of human diseases including the aforementioned examples. We have previously shown that IFN-gamma induces CD40 expression in macrophages and microglia. IFN-gamma leads to STAT-1alpha activation directly and up-regulation of NF-kappaB activity due to the secretion and subsequent autocrine signaling of TNF-alpha. However, TNF-alpha alone is not capable of inducing CD40 expression in these cells. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 protein (SOCS-1) is a cytokine-inducible Src homology 2-containing protein that regulates cytokine receptor signaling by inhibiting STAT-1alpha activation via a specific interaction with activated Janus kinase 2. Given the important role of CD40 in inflammatory events in the CNS as well as other organ systems, it is imperative to understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to both CD40 induction and repression. We show that ectopic expression of SOCS-1 abrogates IFN-gamma-induced CD40 protein expression, mRNA levels, and promoter activity. Additionally, IFN-gamma-induced TNF-alpha secretion, as well as STAT-1alpha and NF-kappaB activation, are inhibited in the presence of SOCS-1. We conclude that SOCS-1 inhibits cytokine-induced CD40 expression by blocking IFN-gamma-mediated STAT-1alpha activation, which also then results in suppression of IFN-gamma-induced TNF-alpha secretion and subsequent NF-kappaB activation.
