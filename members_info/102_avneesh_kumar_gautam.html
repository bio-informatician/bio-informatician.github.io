Avneesh did his Phd in the field of complement biology by using a viral complement regulator as model protein to understand its regulation. Later he became interested in antibody research which brought him to the Wesemann Lab where he worked on different aspects of antibody biology including antibody response to SARS-cov2 spike. Currently, he is more interested to understand the depth and breadth of antibody somatic hypermutation reach. Outside the lab, he likes to learn different aspects of science and go for walks.<br/>
