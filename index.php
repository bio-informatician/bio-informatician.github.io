    <h2>our goals</h2></br>

    <p>The Wesemann laboratory uses mouse genetics, human studies, cellular biology, single cell transcriptomics, and computation to elucidate the underlying features and elasticity of antibody recognition capacity. We study the dynamic regulation, functional significance, and evolutionary implications/origins of the anticipatory naïve antibody repertoire and its somatically evolving counterpart in germinal centers. Findings from these projects have paradigm-shifting potential for fundamental immunology and are relevant to infectious disease, vaccinology, allergy, and autoimmunity.
    The immune system has the ability to recognize, respond, and adapt to a vast array of potential threats. It is integrated throughout the body's other systems and its features include the ability to learn from the past, exhibit dynamic flexibility, and display mind-blowing specificity. It may be an essential aspect of life itself. </p>

    <p>Our main focus is the arm of the immune system traditionally referred to as the adaptive immune system, and its main components–namely, lymphocytes. In particular, we study B lymphocytes, the decisions they make during cellular development and maturation, and the antibodies they produce. We also are interested in gaining insights into the evolutionary origins of the adaptive immune system. Themes of ongoing projects include:</p>
    <p>

<ul>
        <li>Rules governing antibody gene somatic hypermutation and selection.           
        </li>
        <li>How and when do memory B cells and antibody secreting plasma cells make fate decisions.
        </li>
        <li>Elucidating what regulates antibody longevity after vaccination or infection.       
        </li>
        <li>Principles underlying IgE antibody production, distribution, and function. 
        </li>
        <li>Deploy new knowledge to innovate creative biotechnology platforms using germinal center biology for user-defined protein evolution.
        </li>
        <li>Shedding light on origins of immunity in vertebrates.
        </li>
        <li>How the immune system senses, downloads and processes information from the environment, and how this influences dynamic immune function.
        </li>
        <li>Shedding light on origins of immunity in vertebrates.
        </li>

</ul>

We value curiosity-driven science for the sake of science. Our discoveries also hold practical significance in the fields of infectious disease, vaccinology, allergy, cancer, and autoimmunity.
