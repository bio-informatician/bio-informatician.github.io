    <h3>Duane Wesemann, MD, PhD</h3>
    <p style="float: right;">Founder</a>
    <p>Associate Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School</p>
    <p>Associate Physician, Brigham and Women's Hospital</p></br>
    <p>From: Rocky Mountains, USA</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Duane worked odd jobs throughout high school, including paper boy, dishwasher, janitor, wallpaperer, mailbox painter, and ring resizer to pay for flying lessons. He was turned on to biology from a young age and received his MD and PhD with Tika Benveniste studying cell biology and learned B cell biology from Max Cooper and Fred Alt. He currently sees patients that suffer from problems of the immune system. His favorite thing is doing science with his lab team studying the wonders of adaptive immunity. </p>

    <h3>Avneesh Kumar Gautam, PhD</h3>
    <p style="float: right;">Joined 2018</a>
    <p>Ph. D. Biotechnology, National Center for Cell Sciences, 2015</p>
    <p>M. Sc. Biotechnology, IIT Bombay, 2009</p></br>
    <p>From: Uttar Pradesh, India</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Avneesh did his Phd in the field of complement biology by using a viral complement regulator as model protein to understand its regulation. Later he became interested in antibody research which brought him to the Wesemann Lab where he worked on different aspects of antibody biology including antibody response to SARS-cov2 spike. Currently, he is more interested to understand the depth and breadth of antibody somatic hypermutation reach. Outside the lab, he likes to learn different aspects of science and go for walks.</p>

    <h3>Ali Sanjari Moghaddam, MD</h3>
    <p style="float: right;">Joined 2021</a>
    <p>M.D. Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences</p></br>
    <p>From: Qaen, South Khorasan, Iran</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Ali was born and grew up in a small city in the east part of Iran. He is a little shy but friendly. Ali is a science enthusiast, who is following his dream of being a physician-scientist. He is interested in immunology and immunotherapy, in particular cancer immunology. His life has been up and down, but he will always try to do his best.

    <h3>Duck-Kyun “DK” Yoo, PhD</h3>
    <p style="float: right;">Joined 2022</a>
    <p>Ph.D. Biomedical Science, Seoul National University, 2021</p>
    <p>B.S. Plant Science, Seoul National University, 2015</p></br>
    <p>From: Seoul, South Korea</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Duck-Kyun’s doctoral studies involved the development of high-throughput antibody discovery methods utilizing antibody repertoire sequencing. As a postdoc in the Wesemann Lab, his research interests are focused on designing analytical tools in understanding the principles shaping the antibody-antigen interactome. Outside the lab, he loves heavy-eating and long-distance walking/running while listening to music. Let’s share the playlists!

    <h3>Keerti Fnu, PhD</h3>
    <p style="float: right;">Joined 2022</a>
    <p>Ph.D. Life Sciences, Central Drug Research Institute, 2018</p>
    <p>M.Sc Biochemistry, G.B. Pant University of Agriculture & Technology, 2011</p></br>
    <p>From: Dehradun, India</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Keerti inclined towards biological science research during her Master's studies. She's felt motivated in solving puzzled mysteries of biological science. Her doctoral thesis focuses on evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of parasite-derived proteins against experimental leishmaniasis. Further she also gained experience in studying the crosstalk between xenophagy and the immune system. Presently, she's unraveling the functional and physiological relevance of perplexed B-cell immune response during viral infection. Outside the lab, she enjoys gathering with friends, hiking and cooking.

    <h3>Caihong Bi, PhD</h3>
    <p style="float: right;">Joined 2022</a>
    <p>Ph.D. Preventive Veterinary Medicine, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 2021</p>
    <p>MVSc Veterinary Medicine, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 2017</p></br>
    <p>From: Qingdao, Shandong, China</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">Caihong's MVSc studies are related to the structural analysis of epitopes recognized by mAbs against viral proteins. His PhD studies focus on viral regulation on innate immunity. The research experience he possessed makes him addicted to virology and immunology. Currently, he is exploring the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. When he is not thinking about science, he can be found learning new things and listening to music.
